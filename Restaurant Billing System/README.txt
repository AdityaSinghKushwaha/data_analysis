The Restaurant Billing System is a Python-based application that manages restaurant billing efficiently using PostgreSQL as the database. 
It allows users to add items to a cart, update quantities, remove items, calculate the total bill, and process payments.
It stores the bill in a folder for track record and checking monthly sales & profit via bargraph (matplotlib)
It automatically refreshes the database side by side to fetch latest changes done in the system
