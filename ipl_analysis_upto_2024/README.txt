I just wanted to test my concept, so I created this hands-on project within 2 hours to analyze trends across all IPL seasons using Excel and Tableau. The goal was to uncover key insights, player performances, and team statistics through data visualization and advanced analytical techniques.

Tools & Techniques Used :

=> Advance Excel : leveraged VLOOKUPS , formatting functions , Pivot Tables , Slicers & Pivot Charts for data cleaning & preprocessing.

=> Tableau : Applied joins , Context Filters , Top-N parameters , Calculated Fields & multiple visualization techniques to identify trends &             patterns.
